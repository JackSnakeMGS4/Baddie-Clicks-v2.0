# Baddie-Clicks-v2.0
Attempting to re-work the previous repo as UWP and making it easier to work with.

03/21/18: Decided to move one from Baddie Clicks. Everybody's got to move on from their first home eventually (hopefully). 
The amount of work and time that it would take to re-create it the way I wanted easily matches the time and work to create a different 
mini-game. A lot of learning occurred because of you Baddie Clicks and I won't let it go to waste!
